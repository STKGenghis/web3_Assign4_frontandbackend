## 📝 Project Overview

BaseFlow Inventory offers a comprehensive solution for businesses to manage their inventory and sales through blockchain technology:

- **Inventory Management**: Add, update, and track inventory items with secure blockchain storage
- **Invoice Creation**: Generate invoices for customers with automatic blockchain tracking
- **Payment Processing**: Allow customers to pay invoices directly through cryptocurrency
- **Dashboard Analytics**: View key metrics and performance indicators

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Lisk Sepolia testnet
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity with Hardhat
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Web3 Integration**: Wagmi hooks, Scaffold Lisk framework
- **Authentication**: Web3 wallet connection (MetaMask, etc.)
- **Hosting**: Vercel

## 🔍 Features

### Inventory Management
- Add new inventory items with name, quantity, and price
- Update existing inventory with real-time blockchain confirmation
- View inventory levels and value

### Sales & Invoicing
- Create invoices for customers
- Track invoice payment status

## 📈 Project Architecture

The application follows a typical Web3 architecture:
1. **Smart Contracts**: Handle data storage and business logic
2. **Next.js Frontend**: Provides user interface and interaction
3. **Scaffold Lisk Framework**: Connects frontend to blockchain
4. **Wagmi Hooks**: Simplify contract interactions
