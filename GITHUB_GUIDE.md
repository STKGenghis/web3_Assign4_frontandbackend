# GitHub Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to deploy your BaseFlow Inventory project to GitHub:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account.
2. Click on the "+" button in the top right corner and select "New repository".
3. Name your repository (e.g., "baseflow-lisk" or "baseflow-inventory").
4. Add a description (optional): "A blockchain-based inventory management system built on Scaffold Lisk".
5. Choose to make the repository public or private.
6. Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (as we'll be pushing an existing project).
7. Click "Create repository".

## 2. Push Your Project to GitHub

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /home/digitalshaman/scaffold-lisk

# Initialize Git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files to the repository
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit of BaseFlow Inventory on Scaffold Lisk"

# Set the remote repository URL (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPO_NAME with your repository name)
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Set the main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify Your Repository

1. Go to your GitHub profile.
2. Find your new repository in the list.
3. Ensure all your files have been uploaded correctly.
4. Your repository URL will be: `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME`

## 4. Share Your Repository

This is the GitHub repository URL that you will share as part of your deliverables:

```
https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME
```

Be sure to replace "USERNAME" and "REPO_NAME" with your actual GitHub username and the repository name you chose.
